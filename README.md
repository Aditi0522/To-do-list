### Use a To-Do List

Select the to-do list you want to work with. You can add tasks, remove tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The system keeps track of your lists and tasks, making it easy to manage your to-dos.

### Add Tasks

Add multiple tasks to your current to-do list. You can specify the number of tasks and provide their names. Your tasks will be added to the active list.

### Remove Tasks

Remove tasks from your current to-do list by specifying the task name. The task will be removed, and you can continue managing your list.

### Mark Tasks as Completed

Celebrate your achievements by marking tasks as completed. The system will remove the completed tasks from your list and congratulate you.

### Remove a To-Do List

Remove an entire to-do list by specifying the list name. The list will be deleted, and you can focus on your remaining lists.

### Exit the Application

End your session with a cheerful message, wishing you luck on completing your tasks.
